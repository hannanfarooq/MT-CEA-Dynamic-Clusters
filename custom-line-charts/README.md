# Custom Line Charts 
We proposed the custom line charts of three types developed in python. These charts are used to any form of numeric temporal/ time-series data. The code is availble in custom-line-charts.ipynb file.   

**1. Min-Max**: Only the maximum and minimum points on y-axis from the first point(s) of x-axis are connect to the very next point(s) of x-axis and so on until the last point(s) on x-axis. The intermediate points are independent.

**2.  Median** The median of maximum and minimum points are calculated and based on resulted point a single line is displayed.

**3. Pair-Pair** All point(s) on y-axis and x-axis of first are connected to the very next point(s) of x-axis and y-axis.
