# Dynamic cluster donut charts

We have 9 categories available in dataset which are

1. Electrical Engineering(EE)
2. Electrical Lab(EL)
3. Management(MG)
4. Mathematics(MT)
5. Non-Programming(NP)
6. Programming(P)
7. Programming Lab(PL)
8. Social Science(SS)
9. Social Lab(SL)

The dataset was processed through our modified dynamic clustering framework called Mixed Temporal Cluster Evolution Analysis (MT-CEA), to produce students' performance trajectories. The validation of the resultant dynamic clusters from one to six number of clusters on four features(Course Level, performance trend, grade point, and performance gap) are represented using donut charts which are available in folders availble in this directory.
